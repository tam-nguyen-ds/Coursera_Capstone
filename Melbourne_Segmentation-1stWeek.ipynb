    "# __Where to open a new café in Melbourne?: Neighbourhood Segmentation & Analysis__\n",
    "# Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Melbourne is an eventful and multicultural city. The food service industry is thriving, making an impressive contributions to the national economy each year even though the majority of restaurants and café in the country are small businesses. While it is exciting to start a new café business, there are a lot that need to be in the must-do list, such as design a menu, create a detailed business plan, invest in human assets, and the list can go on...\n",
    "\n",
    "Location is (_nearly_) everything to a business success. Even the best dishes and most resourceful staff cannot overcome a challenging venue that lacks potential regular customers or is overwhelmed by abundantly existing competitors, especially when the business is completely new. Many times it is very tempting to choose a busy and attractive spot in the area to set up the business, but even the busiest and most attractive of locations can hinder a successful business.  In this project, the location to open a café in Melbourne is the key aspect that I will strive to give recommendations on, using available datasets.\n",
